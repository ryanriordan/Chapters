>* Using only a portion of the proceeds for an investment
>* Borrow remaining component
>* Margin arrangements differ for stocks and futures

---

>* Minimum margin
  * Minimum level the equity margin can be
  * Currently 30%
  * Set by the securities commissions
>* Margin call
  * Call from the broker for more equity funds

---

## Margin Trading - Initial Conditions

**ABC Corp**  Stock valued at $70

>* 1000    Shares Purchased

>* Assume a 50% Initial Margin

>* 30% Minimum Margin (sometimes called a maintenance margin)

---

## Margin Trading - Initial Position

Value of stock holdings \\$70,000 (\\$70 * 1000)

>* Borrowed  $35,000

>* Equity (i.e. cash) $35,000

---

## Margin Trading - Minimum Margin

Stock price falls from \\$70 to \\$60 per share

**New Position**

>* New value of stock holdings  \\$60,000

>* Borrowed    \\$35,000

>* Equity      \\$25,000 (\\$60,000 - \\$35,000)

>* Margin in % = \\$25,000/\\$60,000 = 41.67%

---

## Margin Trading - Margin Call

* How far can the stock price fall before a margin call?

>* $$\frac{1,000\times P-35,000}{1,000\times P}=.30$$

  >* Therefore, P=50
  >* For an easy calculation ignore the number of shares (1000)
  >* This reduces to $$P-35000=.30*P$$
  >* Then $$P=35,000 / .7$$
  >* Don't forget to divide by the number of shares

---

## Leveraging Effect of Margin Purchases

>* You buy 200 shares of XYZ at \\$100, expecting a 30% appreciation of the stock in one year:
  * Initial margin: 50%
  * Financed by a 9% loan for one year
  * Expected net return: 51% (((\\$130 -50) / 50) - 1.09 = 51%)
>* A 30% drop in the price, though, brings a negative rate of return of -69%.
  * Run through this on your own

---

## Short Sales

>* **Purpose**:  to profit from a decline in the price of a stock or security
>* **Mechanics**:
  * Borrow stock through a dealer
  * Sell it and deposit proceeds and margin in an account
  * Close out the position:  buy the stock and return it to the party who lent it to dealer
>* See the text for some examples of short-selling and margin trading
